# COGS118A_Final_Model_Training

For my final project, I took 3 public datasets: cervical cancer that classifies if a patient has cancer or not based on their health characteristics, wine to classify their class based on their attributes, and breast cancer to classify if a patient has a malignant or benign tumor (2 or 4) based on their health characteristics. These datasets were downloaded off of an open repository of public datasets from UC Irvine. I trained 3 models: logisitic regression, KNN, and SVM on each of these datasets, running 3 trials per dataset using 3 different train/test splits (20/80, 50/50, 80/20) and recording their performance for each trial, each split, each model per dataset, recording 27 different test errors per dataset.
